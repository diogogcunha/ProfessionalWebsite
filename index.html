                                    <summary>Why choose Portugal for a new engineering hub?</summary>
                                    <p>Portugal offers a strong combination of highly skilled engineering talent, high English proficiency, cultural alignment with European and US teams, and a favorable time zone (WEST/WET) for distributed collaboration.</p>
                                </details>
                                <details>
                                    <summary>How long does it take to build a fully operational hub?</summary>
                                    <p>While timelines vary by scale, a typical setup takes 3 to 6 months from initial location analysis and operating model design to onboarding the first core engineering teams and establishing first delivery.</p>
                                </details>
                                <details>
                                    <summary>Do you handle legal entity setup and payroll?</summary>
                                    <p>I focus on the engineering strategy, operating model, and talent acquisition. For legal, tax, and payroll administration, I partner with legal firms and Employer of Record (EOR) providers to ensure a seamless setup.</p>
                                </details>
                                <details>
                                    <summary>How do you ensure the new hub integrates with our existing culture?</summary>
                                    <p>A successful hub is an extension of your company, not an isolated offshore team. I work closely with leadership to design communication structures, align engineering practices, and hire local leaders who champion your core values.</p>

                                <details>
                                    <summary>What happens after the hub is established?</summary>
                                    <p>The goal is to build a self-sustaining organization. Once the hub reaches stable performance, there's a transition of leadership to a permanent local Site Lead or VP of Engineering, remaining available for strategic advisory if needed.</p>

                                    <summary>When is the right time to bring in a Fractional CTO?</summary>
                                    <p>It is ideal when your company needs executive-level technical strategy, is scaling the engineering team, or facing delivery bottlenecks, but doesn't yet require or have the budget for a full-time executive.</p>

                                    <summary>How hands-on are you with the engineering team?</summary>
                                    <p>I operate at the executive level, focusing on architecture strategy, process optimization, and mentoring your existing engineering managers or tech leads, rather than writing code daily.</p>

                                <details>
                                    <summary>Can you help us hire a permanent CTO eventually?</summary>
                                    <p>Yes. A key part of a fractional engagement is often stabilizing the technology organization, defining the exact profile needed for your permanent CTO, and assisting with the interview and handover process.</p>

                                    <p>By participating in executive leadership meetings, understanding your product roadmap and financial constraints, and translating those into a pragmatic technology strategy and clear delivery milestones.</p>

                                    <p>Sessions are remote-first and highly practical. 
                                        For Ad-hoc sessions, we start with a problem contextualization and then go through solution exploration and elimination exercises. Standard session duration is 1 hour but can be extended if possible.
                                        For Cycle sessions we start with a goal-setting session, followed by weekly or bi-weekly 1:1s. Every session starts with a review and reflection of previous action items and ends with concrete actions to apply in your day-to-day role.</p>

                                    <p>Mentorship cycles can run for 4 to 12 weeks. This provides enough time to tackle specific leadership challenges, implement changes, and measure the impact on your team's performance. Payment is structured as a fixed-fee cycle, invoiced in EUR, and paid upfront before the cycle begins.</p>
