                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    A global product organization needed to expand delivery capacity by establishing a dedicated engineering hub in Portugal. The objective was clear: reduce operating costs while maintaining high quality and improving delivery speed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The challenge was to stand up a new team quickly, align it with headquarters standards, and avoid the common friction of distributed execution. The hub had to be effective early and sustainable long term.
                </p>

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    I led the hub setup end to end, from hiring and team design to operating model and client-facing execution.
                </p>
                <h3>1. Lean Team, Clear Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    We built a focused team of 5 engineers with full-stack capability (backend and frontend) and clear ownership boundaries. The setup prioritized accountability, fast decision-making, and measurable delivery goals from day one.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Remote-First Delivery System</h3>
                <p>
                    We implemented a remote-first operating cadence with weekly town halls, Agile cycles, and regular quality checkpoints. This created strong cultural alignment with headquarters while preserving local execution autonomy.
                </p>
                <h3>3. Direct Stakeholder and Client Interaction</h3>
                <p>
                    The hub was positioned as a delivery partner, not a satellite queue. Engineers engaged directly with stakeholders and clients, improving requirement clarity and reducing handoff delays.
                </p>

                <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Faster Time-to-Impact:</strong> Within 6 months, a 5-engineer Portugal team matched the output of a 15-person headquarters team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lower Delivery Cost:</strong> The organization achieved a materially lower cost profile while preserving quality and release reliability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Delivery Throughput:</strong> Deployment rhythm and delivery consistency improved through a stable Agile cadence and direct communication loops.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustained Performance:</strong> The hub operated successfully for 5 years in a fully remote model with continued culture and execution alignment.</li>
                </ul>
