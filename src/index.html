  👋 Hello there, fellow developer! 🕵️‍♂️✨

  I see you inspecting the code! I thought about you and wanted to leave a little note about how this site was built. 

  Here's the tech recipe for this webpage:
  🛠️ Stack: Kept it old-school and clean with Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and local python server. No heavy frameworks here!
  🤖 Tools: Built using GitHub Copilot on VSCode and the CLI.
  🧠 Models: Powered by an ensemble of AI models including Gemini 3.1, GPT5.2 Codex, Claude Sonnet 4.6, Claude Opus 4.6, and Raptor mini.
  🕵️ Agents: I used a multi-agent setup to make sure everything is top-notch:
     - 💻 A Coding agent for the heavy lifting
     - 🔒 A Security agent to keep things safe
     - 🔍 An SEO, AEO, and Accessibility agent to make sure everyone (and every bot) can read it
     - 👥 A Client Personas Validation agent to ensure it hits the right mark with the audience

  Thanks for stopping by and checking under the hood. Happy coding! 🚀

                                        <summary>Why choose Portugal for a new engineering hub?</summary>
                                        <p>Portugal offers a strong combination of highly skilled engineering talent, high English proficiency, cultural alignment with European and US teams, and a favorable time zone (WEST/WET) for distributed collaboration.</p>
                                    </details>
                                    <details>
                                        <summary>Can you help me build a fully remote engineering hub?</summary>
                                        <p>Yes, I can assist in building a fully remote engineering hub by leveraging the global market of software engineers, ensuring effective communication and collaboration tools, and implementing best practices for remote team management.</p>
                                    </details>
                                    <details>
                                        <summary>How long does it take to build a fully operational hub?</summary>
                                        <p>While timelines vary by scale, a typical setup takes 3 to 6 months from initial location analysis and operating model design to onboarding the first core engineering teams and establishing first delivery.</p>
                                    </details>
                                    <details>
                                        <summary>Do you handle legal entity setup and payroll?</summary>
                                        <p>I focus on the engineering strategy, operating model, and talent acquisition and management. For legal, tax, and payroll administration, I partner with legal firms and Employer of Record (EOR) providers to ensure a seamless setup.</p>
                                    </details>
                                    <details>
                                        <summary>How do you ensure the new hub integrates with our existing culture?</summary>
                                        <p>A successful hub is an extension of your company, not an isolated offshore team. I work closely with leadership to design communication structures, align engineering practices, and hire local leaders who champion your core values.</p>

                                    <details>
                                        <summary>What happens after the hub is established?</summary>
                                        <p>The goal is to build a self-sustaining organization. Once the hub reaches stable performance, there's a transition of leadership to a permanent local Site Lead or VP of Engineering, remaining available for strategic advisory if needed.</p>

                                            <p>It is ideal when your company needs executive-level technical strategy, is scaling the engineering team, or facing delivery bottlenecks, but doesn't yet require or have the budget for a full-time executive.</p>

                                            <p>I operate at the executive level, focusing on architecture strategy, process optimization, and mentoring your existing engineering managers or tech leads, participate in system design decision processes, look at code and provide guidance on technical direction.</p>

                                            <p>Yes. A key part of a fractional engagement is often stabilizing the technology organization, defining the exact profile needed for your permanent CTO, and assisting with the interview and handover process.</p>

                                        <summary>Is this technical mentoring or leadership coaching?</summary>
                                        <p>The focus is strictly on engineering leadership, operations, and strategy. We will tackle team performance, stakeholder management, delivery discipline, and organizational design, rather than code-level technical problems (although nerding out on challenges is welcome).</p>

                                        <summary>How are the mentorship sessions structured?</summary>
                                        <p>Sessions are remote-first and highly practical. 
                                            For Ad-hoc sessions, we start with a problem contextualization and then go through solution exploration and elimination exercises. Standard session duration is 1 hour but can be extended if possible.
                                            For Cycle sessions we start with a goal-setting session, followed by weekly or bi-weekly 1:1s. Every session starts with a review and reflection of previous action items and ends with concrete actions to apply in your day-to-day role.</p>

                                            <summary>What is the typical duration of a Cycle engagement?</summary>
                                            <p>Mentorship cycles can run for 4 to 12 weeks. This provides enough time to tackle specific leadership challenges, implement changes, and measure the impact on your team's performance. Payment is structured as a fixed-fee cycle, invoiced in EUR, and paid upfront before the cycle begins.</p>

                                            <p>Not at all. While Portugal is my home base, I work with engineering leaders and distributed teams globally. Sessions are conducted in English or Portuguese.</p>

                                I believe most engineering scaling failures aren't technical, they're organizational. Companies hire engineers but forget to build or improve the system those engineers work within, which leads to inefficiencies and missed opportunities specially in the age of AI we live in.
