                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Without a structured people system, the company risked avoidable attrition, inconsistent performance decisions, and weaker leadership credibility during rapid growth. A fast-growing engineering organization expanded from 25 to 100+ people without a formal career framework, clear progression paths, or a structured feedback cycle. Managers and individual contributors lacked a consistent language for expectations, growth, and performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the first 90 days, the leadership team needed a scalable people system that would improve retention, create stronger manager-IC communication, and keep growth sustainable without introducing bureaucratic friction.
                </p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    I personally designed the career framework, feedback model, and rollout plan with engineering leadership and HR partners. I facilitated calibration sessions, wrote the first versions of level expectations, trained managers on feedback conversations, and iterated the system over two years while the broader leadership team executed it day to day.
                </p>

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Over a two-year implementation, I led the design and rollout of a full people operating model covering mentorship, feedback, and performance management.
                </p>
                <h3>1. Mentorship Network Beyond Org Structure</h3>
                <p>
                    We created a mentor-mentee network independent from the formal org chart, enabling quarterly growth conversations, regular 1:1s, and ad-hoc support channels. This gave engineers safe, consistent communication paths and surfaced issues earlier.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Separate Feedback from Evaluation</h3>
                <p>
                    We decoupled employee feedback from end-of-year performance ratings. The model combined quarterly and ad-hoc feedback loops with annual evaluation and a mid-year checkpoint, reducing anxiety and improving clarity of each process.
                </p>
                <h3>3. Transparent Career Ladder and Expectations</h3>
                <p>
                    We implemented clear role definitions, responsibilities, and progression criteria so engineers could understand what success looked like at each level. Over two years, we iterated the process details to align with cross-department standards and ensure adoption.
                </p>

                <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Retention Improvement:</strong> Employee turnover remained as low as 7% during high-growth phases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stronger Leadership Signal:</strong> Offboarding evaluations reported very high satisfaction with team and leadership quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Faster Issue Discovery:</strong> Managers gained earlier visibility into developer-community challenges through recurring feedback channels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sustainable Scale:</strong> The organization grew past 100 engineers with a clear, transparent, and repeatable performance and career system over two years.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Stakeholder Perspective</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    “Before this framework, growth conversations were inconsistent. Now managers and engineers share the same language, and expectations feel fair and actionable.” — VP Engineering (anonymized)
