                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Without a structured operating model, the company suffered from margin erosion, leadership bottlenecks, unclear stakeholder definition, and inconsistent delivery quality for global clients. The company had a growing engineering team, but no formal service model, limited internal accountability structures, and increasing pressure to deliver consistently across multiple industries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over a transformation that spanned over 12 months, the organization needed to evolve from a single-team setup into a full engineering department capable of scaling sustainably, promoting internal leadership, and maintaining strong financial performance while delivering high-quality outcomes globally on a fully remote model that it had never operated at before.
                </p>

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    I personally led the department redesign, defined service boundaries, clear roles and responsibilities, and set management operating cadences tied to business and productivity KPIs. I coached new engineering managers, ran performance and delivery reviews, evangelising a can do attitude. I designed and orchestrated on proposal development the technical with commercial leadership process and pipeline management while teams executed delivery across the five services.
                </p>

                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    The context demanded a department-wide transformation focused on organization design (for scalability and accountability), leadership development (for internal promotion and capability building), and service clarity (for consistent delivery and client satisfaction).
                </p>
                <h3>1. Service-Based Operating Model</h3>
                <p>
                    We restructured the organization from an informal team setup into five clearly defined engineering services. Each service had explicit ownership boundaries, accountability mechanisms, and measurable delivery objectives defined and shared on documented Operational Level Agreements.
                </p>
                <h3>2. Leadership and Management Community</h3>
                <p>
                    A team of 7 engineering managers minuciosly coordinated across an organizational matrix of services per functions. The vertical services had one responsible engineering manager, and the horizontal functions (excellence, delivery, people, growth, strategy) had one responsible engineering manager each, with one person maintaining more than one role at times. A strategic commitee composing of all engineering managers ensured alignment and decision-making across the organization and interactions with external stakeholders.
                </p>
                <h3>3. Quality and Financial Discipline at Scale</h3>
                <p>
                    We aligned day-to-day engineering operations with OKRs aligned to business goals, balancing delivery quality, client satisfaction, and margin targets on a weekly basis. The department delivered for complex international clients across banking, insurance, fintech, energy, events, and retail.
                </p>

                <h2>The Outcome</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Team Scale:</strong> Expanded the engineering organization from 25 to 100+ professionals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating Clarity:</strong> Established 5 formal engineering services with clear accountability and internal structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Financial Growth:</strong> Increased profit margin from €150K to €750K while scaling capacity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Delivery Quality:</strong> Maintained high delivery standards for global clients in regulated and high-demand sectors.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- <h2>Stakeholder Perspective</h2>
                <blockquote>
                    “The service model gave us real accountability and predictability. We could scale delivery and still improve margin, instead of trading one for the other.” — Managing Director (anonymized)
                </blockquote> -->
